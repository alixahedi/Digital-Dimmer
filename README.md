You can also use the printed circuit board design in the PCB folder.

2. Connect the power supply to the circuit.
3. After connecting the power supply to the circuit to change the value of EEPROM, press one of the buttons.
5. Turn the potentiometer until the output is cut off, then return the potentiometer slightly in the opposite direction.
6. At the end, You can then reduce or increase the output voltage by pressing the buttons on the board.
